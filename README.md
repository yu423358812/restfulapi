## Passport-Oauth

Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is an open-source document database, and leading NoSQL database.
